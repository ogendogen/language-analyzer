chapter   
  
   it can hardly be a coincidence that no language on earth has ever produced the expression as pretty as an airport  
  
   airports are ugly some are very ugly some attain a degree of ugliness that can only be the result of a special effort this ugliness arises because airports are full of people who are tired cross and have just discovered that their luggage has landed in murmansk murmansk airport is the only known exception to this otherwise infallible rule and architects have on the whole tried to reflect this in their designs  
  
   they have sought to highlight the tiredness and crossness motif with brutal shapes and nerve jangling colours to make effortless the business of separating the traveller for ever from his or her luggage or loved ones to confuse the traveller with arrows that appear to point at the windows distant tie racks or the current position of ursa minor in the night sky and wherever possible to expose the plumbing on the grounds that it is functional and conceal the location of the departure gates presumably on the grounds that they are not  
  
   
   caught in the middle of a sea of hazy light and a sea of hazy noise kate schechter stood and doubted  
  
   all the way out of london to heathrow she had suffered from doubt she was not a superstitious person or even a religious person she was simply someone who was not at all sure she should be flying to norway but she was finding it increasingly easy to believe that god if there was a god and if it was remotely possible that any godlike being who could order the disposition of particles at the creation of the universe would also be interested in directing traffic on the m did not want her to fly to norway either all the trouble with the tickets finding a nextdoor neighbour to look after the cat then finding the cat so it could be looked after by the nextdoor neighbour the sudden leak in the roof the missing wallet the weather the unexpected death of the nextdoor neighbour the pregnancy of the cat  it all had the semblance of an orchestrated campaign of obstruction which had begun to assume godlike proportions  
  
   even the taxidriver  when she had eventually found a taxi had said norway what you want to go there for and when she hadnt instantly said ‘the aurora borealis or fjords but had looked doubtful for a moment and bitten her lip he had said i know i bet its some bloke dragging you out there tell you what tell him to stuff it go to tenerife  
  
   there was an idea  
  
   tenerife  
  
   or even she dared to think for a fleeting second home  
  
   she had stared dumbly out of the taxi window at the angry tangles of traffic and thought that however cold and miserable the weather was here that was nothing to what it would be like in norway  
  
   or indeed at home home would be about as icebound as norway right now icebound and punctuated with geysers of steam bursting out of the ground catching in the frigid air and dissipating between the glacial cliff faces of sixth avenue  
  
   a quick glance at the itinerary kate had pursued in the course of her thirty years would reveal her without any doubt to be a new yorker for though she had lived in the city very little most of her life had been spent at a constant distance from it los angeles san francisco europe and a period of distracted wandering around south america five years ago following the loss of her newly mated husband luke in a new york taxi hailing accident  
  
   she enjoyed the notion that new york was home and that she missed it but in fact the only thing she really missed was pizza and not just any old pizza but the sort of pizza they brought to your door if you phoned them up and asked them to that was the only real pizza pizza that you had to go out and sit at a table staring at red paper napkins for wasnt real pizza however much extra pepperoni and anchovy they put on it  
  
   london was the place she liked living in most apart of course from the pizza problem which drove her crazy why would no one deliver pizza why did no one understand that it was fundamental to the whole nature of pizza that it aimed at your front door in a hot cardboard box that you slithered it out of greaseproof paper and ate it in folded slices in front of the tv what was the fundamental flaw in the stupid stuckup and sluggardly english that they couldn’t grasp this simple principle for some odd reason it was the one frustration she could never learn simply to live with and accept and about once a month or so she would get very depressed phone a pizza restaurant order the biggest most lavish pizza she could describe  pizza with an extra pizza on it essentially  and then sweetly ask them to deliver it  
  
   to what  
  
   deliver let me give you the address    
  
   i don’t understand arent you going to come and pick it up  
  
   no arent you going to deliver my address    
  
   er we dont do that miss  
  
   dont do what  
  
   er deliver     
  
   you don’t deliver  am i hearing you correctly  
  
   the exchange would quickly degenerate into an ugly slanging match which would leave her feeling drained and shaky but much much better the following morning in all other respects she was one of the most sweetnatured people you could hope to meet  
  
   but today was testing her to the limit  
  
   there had been terrible traffic jams on the motorway and when the distant flash of blue lights made it clear that the cause was an accident somewhere ahead of them kate had become more tense and had stared fixedly out of the other window as eventually they had crawled past it  
  
   the taxidriver had been badtempered when at last he had dropped her off because she didnt have the right money and there was a lot of disgruntled hunting through tight trouser pockets before he was eventually able to find change for her the atmosphere was heavy and thundery and now standing in the middle of the main checkin concourse at terminal two heathrow airport she could not find the checkin desk for her flight to oslo  
  
   she stood very still for a moment breathing calmly and deeply and trying not to think of jeanphilippe  
  
   jeanphilippe was as the taxidriver had correctly guessed the reason why she was going to norway but was also the reason why she was convinced that norway was not at all a good place for her to go thinking of him therefore made her head oscillate and it seemed best not to think about him at all but simply to go to norway as if that was where she happened to be going anyway she would then be terribly surprised to bump into him at whatever hotel it was he had written on the card that was tucked into the side pocket of her handbag  
  
   in fact she would be surprised to find him there anyway what she would be much more likely to find was a message from him saying that he had been unexpectedly called away to guatemala seoul or tenerife and that he would call her from there jeanphilippe was the most continually absent person she had ever met in this he was the culmination of a series since she had lost luke to the great yellow chevrolet she had been oddly dependent on the rather vacant emotions that a succession of selfabsorbed men had inspired in her  
  
   she tried to shut all this out of her mind and even shut her eyes for a second she wished that when she opened them again there would be a sign in front of her saying this way for norway» which she could simply follow without needing to think about it or anything else ever again this she reflected in a continuation of her earlier train of thought was presumably how religions got started and must be the reason why so many sects hang around airports looking for converts they know that people there are at their most vulnerable and perplexed and ready to accept any kind of guidance  
  
   kate opened her eyes again and was of course disappointed but then a second or two later there was a momentary parting in a long surging wave of cross germans in inexplicable yellow polo shirts and through it she had a brief glimpse of the checkin desk for oslo lugging her garment bag on to her shoulder she made her way towards it  
  
   there was just one other person before her in the line at the desk and he it turned out was having trouble or perhaps making it  
  
   he was a large man impressively large and wellbuilt  even expertly built  but he was also definitely oddlooking in a way that kate couldnt quite deal with she couldnt even say what it was that was odd about him only that she was immediately inclined not to include him on her list of things to think about at the moment she remembered reading an article which had explained that the central processing unit of the human brain only had seven memory registers which meant that if you had seven things in your mind at the same time and then thought of something else one of the other seven would instantly drop out  
  
   in quick succession she thought about whether or not she was likely to catch the plane about whether it was just her imagination that the day was a particularly bloody one about airline staff who smile charmingly and are breathtakingly rude about duty free shops which are able to charge much lower prices than ordinary shops but  mysteriously  dont about whether or not she felt a magazine article about airports coming on which might help pay for the trip about whether her garment bag would hurt less on her other shoulder and finally in spite of all her intentions to the contrary  about jeanphilippe who was another set of at lest seven subtopics all to himself  
  
   the man standing arguing in front of her popped right out of her mind  
  
   it was only the announcement on the airport tannoy of the last call for her flight to oslo which forced her attention back to the situation in front of her  
  
   the large man was making trouble about the fact that he hadnt been given a first class seat reservation it had just transpired that the reason for this was that he didnt in fact have a first class ticket  
  
   kates spirits sank to the very bottom of her being and began to prowl around there making a low growling noise  
  
   it now transpired that the man in front of her didnt actually have a ticket at all and the argument then began to range freely and angrily over such topics as the physical appearance of the airline checkin girl her qualities as a person theories about her ancestors speculations as to what surprises the future might have in store for her and the airline for which she worked and finally lit by chance on the happy subject of the mans credit card  
  
   he didnt have one  
  
   further discussions ensued and had to do with cheques and why the airline did not accept them  
  
   kate took a long slow murderous look at her watch  
  
   excuse me she said interrupting the transactions is this going to take long i have to catch the oslo flight  
  
   im just dealing with this gentleman said the girl ill be with you in just one second  
  
   kate nodded and politely allowed just one second to go by  
  
   its just that the flights about to leave she said then i have one bag i have my ticket i have a reservation itll take about thirty seconds i hate to interrupt but id hate even more to miss my flight for the sake of thirty seconds thats thirty actual seconds not thirty just one seconds which could keep us here all night  
  
   the checkin girl turned the full glare of her lipgloss on to kate but before she could speak the large blond man looked round and the effect of his face was a little disconcerting  
  
   i too he said in a slow angry nordic voice wish to fly to oslo  
  
   kate stared at him he looked thoroughly out of place in an airport or rather the airport looked thoroughly out of place around him  
  
   well she said the way were stacked up at the moment it looks like neither of us is going to make it can we just sort this one out whats the holdup  
  
   the checkin girl smiled her charming dead smile and said the airline does not accept cheques as a matter of company policy  
  
   well i do said kate slapping down her own credit card charge the gentlemans ticket to this and ill take a cheque from him  
  
   ok she added to the big man who was looking at her with slow surprise his eyes were large and blue and conveyed the impression that they had looked at a lot of glaciers in their time they were extraordinarily arrogant and also muddled  
  
   ok she repeated briskly my name is kate schechter two cs two hs two es and also a t an r and an s provided theyre all there the bank wont be fussy about the order they come in they never seem to know themselves  
  
   the man very slowly inclined his head a little towards her in a rough bow of acknowledgement he thanked her for her kindness courtesy and some norwegian word that was lost on her said that it was a long while since he had encountered anything of the kind that she was a woman of spirit and some other norwegian word and that he was indebted to her he also added as an afterthought that he had no chequebook  
  
   right said kate determined not to be deflected from her course she fished in her handbag for a piece of paper took a pen from the checkin counter scribbled on the paper and thrust it at him  
  
   thats my address she said send me the money hock your fur coat if you have to just send it me ok im taking a flyer on trusting you  
  
   the big man took the scrap of paper read the few words on it with immense slowness then folded it with elaborate care and put it into the pocket of his coat again he bowed to her very slightly  
  
   kate suddenly realised that the checkin girl was silently waiting for her pen back to fill in the credit card form she pushed it back at her in annoyance handed over her own ticket and imposed on herself an icy calm  
  
   the airport tannoy announced the departure of their flight  
  
   may i see your passports please said the girl unhurriedly  
  
   kate handed hers over but the big man didnt have one  
  
   you what exclaimed kate the airline girl simply stopped moving at all and stared quietly at a random point on her desk waiting for someone else to make a move it wasnt her problem  
  
   the man repeated angrily that he didnt have a passport he shouted it and banged his fist on the counter so hard that it was slightly dented by the force of the blow  
  
   kate picked up her ticket her passport and her credit card and hoisted her garment bag back up on to her shoulder  
  
   this is when i get off she said and simply walked away she felt that she had made every effort a human being could possibly be expected to make to catch her plane but that it was not to be she would send a message to jeanphilippe saying that she could not be there and it would probably sit in a slot next to his message to her saying why he could not be there either for once they would be equally absent  
  
   for the time being she would go and cool off she set off in search of first a newspaper and then some coffee and by dint of following the appropriate signs was unable to locate either she was then unable to find a working phone from which to send a message and decided to give up on the airport altogether just get out she told herself find a taxi and go back home  
  
   she threaded her way back across the checkin concourse and had almost made it to the exit when she happened to glance back at the checkin desk that had defeated her and was just in time to see it shoot up through the roof engulfed in a ball of orange flame  
  
   as she lay beneath a pile of rubble in pain darkness and choking dust trying to find sensation in her limbs she was at least relieved to be able to think that she hadnt merely been imagining that this was a bad day so thinking she passed out  
  
chapter   
  
   the usual people tried to claim responsibility  
  
   first the ira then the plo and the gas board even british nuclear fuels rushed out a statement to the effect that the situation was completely under control that it was a one in a million chance that there was hardly any radioactive leakage at all and that the site of the explosion would make a nice location for a day out with the kids and a picnic before finally having to admit that it wasnt actually anything to do with them at all  
  
   no cause could be found for the explosion  
  
   it seemed to have happened spontaneously and of its own free will explanations were advanced but most of these were simply phrases which restated the problem in different words along the same principles which had given the world metal fatigue in fact a very similar phrase was invented to account for the sudden transition of wood metal plastic and concrete into an explosive condition which was nonlinear catastrophic structural exasperation or to put it another way  as a junior cabinet minister did on television the following night in a phrase which was to haunt the rest of his career  the checkin desk had just got fundamentally fed up with being where it was  
  
   as in all such disastrous events estimates of the casualties varied wildly they started at fortyseven dead eightynine seriously injured went up to sixtythree dead a hundred and thirty injured and rose as high as one hundred and seventeen dead before the figures started to be revised downwards once more the final figures revealed that once all the people who could be accounted for had been accounted for in fact no one had been killed at all a small number of people were in hospital suffering from cuts and bruises and varying degrees of traumatised shock but that unless anyone had any information about anybody actually being missing was that  
  
   this was yet another inexplicable aspect to the whole affair the force of the explosion had been enough to reduce a large part of the front of terminal two to rubble and yet everyone inside the building had somehow either fallen very luckily or been shielded from one piece of falling masonry by another or had the shock of the explosion absorbed by their luggage all in all very little luggage had survived at all there were questions asked in parliament about this but not very interesting ones  
  
   
  
   it was a couple of days before kate schechter became aware of any of these things or indeed of anything at all in the outside world  
  
   she passed the time quietly in a world of her own in which she was surrounded as far as the eye could see with old cabin trunks full of past memories in which she rummaged with great curiosity and sometimes bewilderment or at least about a tenth of the cabin trunks were full of vivid and often painful or uncomfortable memories of her past life the other ninetenths were full of penguins which surprised her insofar as she recognized at all that she was dreaming she realized that she must have been exploring her own subconscious mind she had heard it said that humans are supposed only to use about a tenth of their brains and that no one was very clear what the other ninetenths were for but she had certainly never heard it suggested that they were used for storing penguins  
  
   gradually the trunks the memories and the penguins began to grow indistinct to become all white and swimmy then to become like walls that were all white and swimmy and finally to become walls that were merely white or rather a yellowish greenish kind of offwhite and to enclose her in a small room  
  
   the room was in semidarkness a bedside light was on but turned down low and the light from a street lamp found its way between the grey curtains and threw sodium patterns on the opposite wall she became dimly aware of the shadowed shape of her own body lying under the white turneddown sheet and the pale neat blankets she stared at it for a nervous while checking that it looked right before she tried tentatively to move any part of it she tried her right hand and that seemed to be fine a little stiff and aching but the fingers all responded and all seemed to be of the right length and thickness and to bend in the right places and in the right directions  
  
   she panicked briefly when she couldnt immediately locate her left hand but then she found it lying across her stomach and nagging at her in some odd way it took her a second or two of concentration to put together a number of rather disturbing feelings and realize that there was a needle bandaged into her arm this shook her quite badly from the needle there snaked a long thin transparent pipe that glistened yellowly in the light from the street lamp and hung in a gentle curl from a thick plastic bag suspended from a tall metal stand an array of horrors briefly assailed her in respect of this apparatus but she peered dimly at the bag and saw the words dextrosaline she made herself calm down again and lay quietly for a few moments before continuing her exploration  
  
   her ribcage seemed undamaged bruised and tender but there was no sharper pain anywhere to suggest that anything was broken her hips and thighs ached and were stiff but revealed no serious hurt she flexed the muscles down her right leg and then her left she rather fancied that her left ankle was sprained  
  
   in other words she told herself she was perfectly all right so what was she doing here in what she could tell from the septic colour of the paint was clearly a hospital  
  
   she sat up impatiently and immediately rejoined the penguins for an entertaining few minutes  
  
   the next time she came round she treated herself with a little more care and lay quietly feeling gently nauseous  
  
   she poked gingerly at her memory of what had happened it was dark and blotchy and came at her in sick greasy waves like the north sea lumpy things jumbled themselves out of it and slowly arranged themselves into a heaving airport the airport was sour and ached in her head and in the middle of it pulsing like a migraine was the memory of a moments whirling splurge of light  
  
   it became suddenly very clear to her that the checkin concourse of terminal two at heathrow airport had been hit by a meteorite silhouetted in the flare was the furcoated figure of a big man who must have caught the full force of it and been reduced instantly to a cloud of atoms that were free to go as they pleased the thought caused a deep and horrid shudder to go through her he had been infuriating and arrogant but she had liked him in an odd way there had been something oddly noble in his perverse bloodymindedness or maybe she realized she liked to think that such perverse bloodymindedness was noble because it reminded her of her trying to order pizza to be delivered in an alien hostile and nonpizzadelivering world nobleness was one word for making a fuss about the trivial inevitabilities of life but there were others  
  
   she felt a sudden surge of fear and loneliness but it quickly ebbed away and left her feeling much more composed relaxed and wanting to go to the lavatory  
  
   according to her watch it was shortly after three oclock and according to everything else it was nighttime she should probably call a nurse and let the world know she had come round there was a window in the sidewall of the room through which she could see a dim corridor in which stood a stretcher trolley and a tall black oxygen bottle but which was otherwise empty things were very quiet out there  
  
   peering around her in the small room she saw a whitepainted plywood cupboard a couple of tubular steel and vinyl chairs lurking quietly in the shadows and a whitepainted plywood bedside cabinet which supported a small bowl with a single banana in it on the other side of the bed stood her drip stand set into the wall on that side of the bed was a metal plate with a couple of black knobs and a set of old bakelite headphones hanging from it and wound around the tubular side pillar of the bedhead was a cable with a bell push attached to it which she fingered and then decided not to push  
  
   she was fine she could find her own way about  
  
   slowly a little woozily she pushed herself up on to her elbows and slid her legs out from under the sheets and on to the floor which was cold to her feet she could tell almost immediately that she shouldnt be doing this because every part of her feet was sending back streams of messages telling her exactly what every tiniest bit of the floor that they touched felt like as if it was a strange and worrying thing the like of which they had never encountered before nevertheless she sat on the edge of the bed and made her feet accept the floor as something they were just going to have to get used to  
  
   the hospital had put her into a large baggy striped thing it wasnt merely baggy she decided on examining it more closely it actually was a bag a bag of loose blue and white striped cotton it opened up the back and let in chilly night draughts perfunctory sleeves flopped halfway down her arms she moved her arms around in the light examining the skin rubbing it and pinching it especially around the bandage which held her drip needle in place normally her arms were lithe and the skin was firm and supple tonight however they looked like bits of chickens briefly she smoothed each forearm with her other hand and then looked up again purposefully  
  
   she reached out and gripped the drip stand and because it wobbled slightly less than she did she was able to use it to pull herself slowly to her feet she stood there her tall slim figure trembling and after a few seconds she held the drip stand away at a bent arms length like a shepherd holding a crook  
  
   she had not made it to norway but she was at least standing up  
  
   the drip stand rolled on four small and independently perverse wheels which behaved like four screaming children in a supermarket but nevertheless kate was able to propel it to the door ahead of her walking increased her sense of wooziness but also increased her resolve not to give in to it she reached the door opened it and pushing the drip stand out ahead of her looked out into the corridor  
  
   to her left the corridor ended in a couple of swingdoors with circular porthole windows which seemed to lead into a larger area an open ward perhaps to her right a number of smaller doors opened off the corridor as it continued on for a short distance before turning a sharp corner one of those doors would probably be the lavatory the others well she would find out as she looked for the lavatory  
  
   the first two were cupboards the third was slightly bigger and had a chair in it and therefore probably counted as a room since most people dont like to sit in cupboards even nurses who have to do a lot of things that most people wouldnt like to it also had a stack of styro beakers a lot of semicongealed coffee creamer and an elderly coffee maker all sitting on top of a small table together and seeping grimly over a copy of the evening standard  
  
   kate picked up the dark damp paper and tried to reconstruct some of her missing days from it however what with her own wobbly condition making it difficult to read and the droopily stucktogether condition of the newspaper she was able to glean little more than the fact that no one could really say for certain what had happened it seemed that no one had been seriously hurt but that an employee of one of the airlines was still unaccounted for the incident had now been officially classified as an act of god  
  
   nice one god thought kate she put down the remains of the paper and closed the door behind her  
  
   the next door she tried was another small side ward like her own there was a bedside table and a single banana in the fruit bowl  
  
   the bed was clearly occupied she pulled the door to quickly but she did not pull it quickly enough unfortunately something odd had caught her attention but although she had noticed it she could not immediately say what it was she stood there with the door half closed staring at the door knowing that she should not look again and knowing that she would  
  
   carefully she eased the door back open again  
  
   the room was darkly shadowed and chilly the chilliness did not give her a good feeling about the occupant of the bed she listened the silence didnt sound too good either it wasnt the silence of healthy deep sleep it was the silence of nothing but a little distant traffic noise  
  
   she hesitated for a long while silhouetted in the doorway looking and listening she wondered about the sheer bulk of the occupant of the bed and how cold he was with just a thin blanket pulled over him next to the bed was a small tubularlegged vinyl bucket chair which was rather overwhelmed by the huge and heavy fur coat draped over it and kate thought that the coat should more properly be draped over the bed and its cold occupant  
  
   at last walking as softly and cautiously as she could she moved into the room and over to the bed she stood looking down at the face of the big nordic man though cold and though his eyes were shut his face was frowning slightly as if he was still rather worried about something this struck kate as being almost infinitely sad in life the man had had the air of someone who was beset by huge if somewhat puzzling difficulties and the appearance that he had almost immediately found things beyond this life that were a bother to him as well was miserable to contemplate  
  
   she was astonished that he appeared to be so unscathed his skin was totally unmarked it was rugged and healthy – or rather had been healthy until very recently closer inspection showed a network of fine lines which suggested that he was older than the midthirties she had originally assumed he could even have been a very fit and healthy man in his late forties  
  
   standing against the wall by the door was something unexpected it was a large cocacola vending machine it didnt look as if it had been installed there it wasnt plugged in and it had a small neat sticker on it explaining that it was temporarily out of order it looked as if it had simply been left there inadvertently by someone who was probably even now walking around wondering which room he had left it in its large red and white wavy panel stared glassily into the room and did not explain itself the only thing the machine communicated to the outside world was that there was a slot into which coins of a variety of denominations might be inserted and an aperture to which a variety of different cans would be delivered if the machine was working which it was not there was also an old sledgehammer leaning against it which was in its own way odd  
  
   faintness began to creep over kate the room began to develop a slight spin and there was some restless rustling in the cabin trunks of her mind  
  
   then she realised that the rustling wasnt simply her imagination there was a distinct noise in the room  a heavy beating scratching noise a muffled fluttering the noise rose and fell like the wind but in her dazed and woozy state kate could not at first tell where the noise was coming from at last her gaze fell on the curtains she stared at them with the worried frown of a drunk trying to work out why the door is dancing the sound was coming from the curtains she walked uncertainly towards them and pulled them apart a huge eagle with circles tattooed on its wings was clattering and beating against the window staring in with great yellow eyes and pecking wildly at the glass  
  
   kate staggered back turned and tried to heave herself out of the room at the end of the corridor the porthole doors swung open and two figures came through them hands rushed towards her as she became hopelessly entangled in the drip stand and began slowly to spin towards the floor  
  
   she was unconscious as they carefully laid her back in her bed she was unconscious half an hour later when a disturbingly short figure in a worryingly long white doctors coat arrived wheeled the big man away on a stretcher trolley and then returned after a few minutes for the cocacola machine  
  
   she woke a few hours later with a wintry sun seeping through the window the day looked very quiet and ordinary but kate was still shaking  
  
chapter   
  
  the same sun later broke in through the upper windows of a house in north london and struck the peacefully sleeping figure of a man  
  
  the room in which he slept was large and bedraggled and did not much benefit from the sudden intrusion of light the sun crept slowly across the bedclothes as if nervous of what it might find amongst them slunk down the side of the bed moved in a rather startled way across some objects it encountered on the floor toyed nervously with a couple of motes of dust lit briefly on a stuffed fruitbat hanging in the corner and fled  
  
  this was about as big an appearance as the sun ever put in here and it lasted for about an hour or so during which time the sleeping figure scarcely stirred  
  
  at eleven oclock the phone rang and still the figure did not respond any more than it had responded when the phone had rung at twentyfive to seven in the morning again at twenty to seven again at ten to seven and again for ten minutes continuously starting at five to seven after which it has settled into a long and significant silence disturbed only by the braying of police sirens in a nearby street at around nine oclock the delivery of a large eighteenthcentury dual manual harpsichord at around ninefifteen and the collection of same by bailiffs at a little after ten this was a not uncommon sort of occurrence the people concerned were accustomed to finding the key under the doormat and the man in the bed was accustomed to sleeping through it you would probably not say that he was sleeping the sleep of the just unless you meant the just asleep but it was certainly the sleep of someone who was not fooling about when he climbed into bed of a night and turned off the light  
  
  the room was not a room to elevate the soul louis xiv to pick a name at random would not have liked it would have found it not sunny enough and insufficiently full of mirrors he would have desired someone to pick up the socks put the records away and maybe burn the place down michelangelo would have been distressed by its proportions which were neither lofty nor shaped by any noticeable inner harmony or symmetry other than that all parts of the room were pretty much equally full of old coffee mugs shoes and brimming ashtrays most of which were now sharing their tasks with each other the walls were painted in almost precisely that shade of green which raffaello sanzio would have bitten off his own right hand at the wrist rather than use and hercules on seeing the room would probably have returned half an hour later armed with a navigable river it was in short a dump and was likely to remain so for as long as it remained in the custody of mr svlad or dirk gently n cjelli  
  
  at last gently stirred  
  
  the sheets and blankets were pulled up tightly around his head but from somewhere half way down the length of the bed a hand slowly emerged from under the bedclothes and its fingers felt their way in little tapping movements along the floor working from experience they neatly circumvented a bowl of something very nasty that had been sitting there since michaelmas and eventually happened upon a halfempty pack of untapped gauloises and a box of matches the fingers shook a crumpled white tube free of the pack seized it and the box of matches and then started to poke a way through the sheets tangled together at the top of the bed like a magician prodding at a handkerchief from which he intends to release a flock of doves  
  
  the cigarette was at last inserted into the hole the cigarette was lit for a while the bed itself appeared to be smoking the cigarette in great heaving drags it coughed long loud and shudderingly and then began at last to breathe in a more measured rhythm in this way dirk gently achieved consciousness  
  
  he lay there for a while feeling a terrible sense of worry and guilt about something weighing on his shoulders he wished he could forget about it and promptly did he levered himself out of bed and a few minutes later padded downstairs  
  
  the mail on the doormat consisted of the usual things a rude letter threatening to take away his american express card an invitation to apply for an american express card and a few bills of the more hysterical and unrealistic type he couldnt understand why they kept sending them the cost of the postage seemed merely to be good money thrown after bad he shook his head in wonderment at the malevolent incompetence of the world threw the mail away entered the kitchen and approached the fridge with caution  
  
  it stood in the corner  
  
  the kitchen was large and shrouded in a deep gloom that was not relieved only turned yellow by the action of switching on the light dirk squatted down in front of the fridge and carefully examined the edge of the door he found what he was looking for in fact he found more than he was looking for  
  
  near the bottom of the door across the narrow gap which separated the door from the main body of the fridge which held the strip of grey insulating rubber lay a single human hair it was stuck there with dried saliva that he had expected he had stuck it there himself three days earlier and had checked it on several occasions since then what he had not expected to fine was a second hair  
  
  he frowned at it in alarm a second hair  
  
  it was stuck across the gap in the same way as the first one only this hair was near the top of the fridge door and he had not put it there he peered at it closely and even went so far as to go and open the old shutters on the kitchen windows to let some extra light in upon the scene  
  
  the daylight shouldered its way in like a squad of policemen and did a lot of whatsallhissing around the room which like the bedroom would have presented anyone of an aesthetic disposition with difficulties like most of the rooms in dirks house it was large looming and utterly dishevelled it simply sneered at anyones attempts to tidy it sneered at them and brushed them aside like one of the small pile of dead and disheartened flies that lay beneath the window on top of a pile of old pizza boxes  
  
  the light revealed the second hair for what it was – a grey hair at root dyed a vivid metallic orange dirk pursed his lips and thought very deeply he didnt need to think hard in order to realise who the hair belonged to  there was only one person who regularly entered the kitchen looking as if her head had been used for extracting metal oxides from industrial waste  but he did have seriously to consider the implications of the discovery that she had been plastering her hair across the door of his fridge  
  
  it meant that the silently waged conflict between himself and his cleaning lady had escalated to a new and more frightening level it was now dirk reckoned fully three months since this fridge door had been opened and each of them was grimly determined not to be the one to open it first the fridge no longer merely stood there in the comer of the kitchen it actually lurked dirk could quite clearly remember the day on which the thing had started lurking it was about a week ago when dirk had tried a simple subterfuge to trick elena  the old bats name was elena pronounced to rhyme with cleaner which was an irony that dirk now no longer relished  into opening the fridge door the subterfuge had been deftly deflected and had nearly rebounded horribly on dirk  
  
  he had resorted to the strategy of going to the local minimarket to buy a few simple groceries nothing contentious  a little milk some eggs some bacon a carton or two of chocolate custard and a simple halfpound of butter he had left them innocently on top of the fridge as if to say oh when you have a moment perhaps you could pop these inside  
  
  when he had returned that evening his heart bounded to see that they were no longer on top of the fridge they were gone they had not been merely moved aside or put on a shelf they were nowhere to be seen she must finally have capitulated and put them away in the fridge and she would surely have cleaned it out once it was actually open for the first and only time his heart swelled with warmth and gratitude towards her and he was about to fling open the door of the thing in relief and triumph when an eighth sense at the last count dirk reckoned he had eleven warned him to be very very careful and to consider first where elena might have put the cleared out contents of the fridge  
  
  a nameless doubt gnawed at his mind as he moved noiselessly towards the garbage bin beneath the sink holding his breath he opened the lid and looked  
  
  there nestling in the folds of the fresh black bin liner were his eggs his bacon his chocolate custard and his simple halfpound of butter two milk bottles stood rinsed and neatly lined up by the sink into which their contents had presumably been poured  
  
  she had thrown it away  
  
  rather than open the fridge door she had thrown his food away he looked round slowly at the grimy squat white monolith and that was the exact moment at which he realized without a shadow of a doubt that his fridge had now begun seriously to lurk  
  
  he made himself a stiff black coffee and sat slightly trembling he had not even looked directly at the sink but he knew that he must unconsciously have noticed the two clean milk bottles there and some busy part of his mind had been alarmed by them  
  
  the next day he had explained all this away to himself he was becoming needlessly paranoiac it had surely been an innocent or careless mistake on elenas part she had probably been brooding distractedly on her sons attack of bronchitis peevishness or homosexuality or whatever it was that regularly prevented her from either turning up or from having noticeable effect when she did she was italian and probably had absentmindedly mistaken his food for garbage  
  
  but the business with the hair changed all that it established beyond all possible doubt that she knew exactly what she was doing she was under no circumstances going to open the fridge door until he had opened it first and he was under no circumstances going to open the fridge until she had  
  
  obviously she had not noticed his hair otherwise it would have been her most effective course simply to pull it off thus tricking him into thinking she had opened the fridge he should presumably now remove her hair in the hope of pulling that same trick on her but even as he sat there he knew that somehow that wouldnt work and that they were locked into a tightening spiral of nonfridgeopening that would lead them both to madness or perdition  
  
  he wondered if he could hire someone to come and open the fridge  
  
  no he was not in a position to hire anybody to do anything he was not even in a position to pay elena for the last three weeks the only reason he didnt ask her to leave was that sacking somebody inevitably involved paying them off and this he was in no position to do his secretary had finally left him on her own initiative and gone off to do something reprehensible in the travel business dirk had attempted to cast scorn on her preferring monotony of pay over  
  
  regularity of pay she had calmly corrected him  
  
   over job satisfaction  
  
  she had nearly said over what but at that moment she realised that if she said that she would have to listen to his reply which would be bound to infuriate her into arguing back it occurred to her for the first time that the only way of escaping was just not to get drawn into these arguments if she simply did not respond this time then she was free to leave she tried it she felt a sudden freedom she left a week later in much the same mood she married an airline cabin steward called smith  
  
  dirk had kicked her desk over and then had to pick it up himself later when she didnt come back  
  
  the detective business was currently as brisk as the tomb nobody it seemed wished to have anything detected he had recently to make ends meet taken up doing palmistry in drag on thursday evenings but he wasnt comfortable with it he could have withstood it  the hateful abject humiliation of it all was something to which he had in different ways now become accustomed and he was quite anonymous in his little tent in the back garden of the pub  he could have withstood it all if he hadnt been so horribly excruciatingly good at it it made him break out in a sweat of selfloathing he tried by every means to cheat to fake to be deliberately and cynically bad but whatever fakery he tried to introduce always failed and he invariably ended up being right  
  
  his worst moment had come about as a result of the poor woman from oxfordshire who had come in to see him one evening being in something of a waggish mood he had suggested that she should keep an eye on her husband who judging by her marriage line looked to be a bit of a flighty type it transpired that her husband was in fact a fighter pilot and that his plane had been lost in an exercise over the north sea only a fortnight earlier  
  
  dirk had been flustered by this and had soothed meaninglessly at her he was certain he said that her husband would be restored to her in the fullness of time that all would be well and that all manner of things would be well and so on the woman said that she thought this was not very likely seeing as the world record for staying alive in the north sea was rather less than an hour and since no trace of her husband had been found in two weeks it seemed fanciful to imagine that he was anything other than stone dead and she was trying to get used to the idea thank you very much she said it rather tartly  
  
  dirk had lost all control at this point and started to babble  
  
  he said that it was very clear from reading her hands that the great sum of money she had coming to her would be no consolation to her for the loss of her dear dear husband but that at least it might comfort her to know that he had gone on to that great something or other in the sky that he was floating on the fleeciest of white clouds looking very handsome in his new set of wings and that he was terribly sorry to be talking such appalling drivel but she had caught him rather by surprise would she care for some tea or some vodka or some soup  
  
  the woman demurred she said she had only wandered into the tent by accident she had been looking for the lavatories and what was that about the money  
  
  complete gibberish dirk had explained he was in great difficulties what with having the falsetto to keep up i was making it up as i went along he said please allow me to tender my most profound apologies for intruding so clumsily on your private grief and to escort you to er or rather direct you to the well what i can only in the circumstances call the lavatory which is out of the tent and on the left  
  
  dirk had been cast down by this encounter but was then utterly horrified a few days later when he discovered that the very following morning the unfortunate woman had learnt that she had won  on the premium bonds he spent several hours that night standing on the roof of his house shaking his fist at the dark sky and shouting stop it until a neighbour complained to the police that he couldnt sleep the police had come round in a screaming squad car and woken up the rest of the neighbourhood as well  
  
   
  
  today this morning dirk sat in his kitchen and stared dejectedly at his fridge the bloodyminded ebullience which he usually relied on to carry him through the day had been knocked out of him in its very opening moments by the business with the fridge his will sat imprisoned in it locked up by a single hair  
  
  what he needed he thought was a client please god he thought if there is a god any god bring me a client just a simple client the simpler the better credulous and rich someone like that chap yesterday he tapped his fingers on the table  
  
  the problem was that the more credulous the client the more dirk fell foul at the end of his own better nature which was constantly rearing up and embarrassing him at the most inopportune moments dirk frequently threatened to hurl his better nature to the ground and kneel on its windpipe but it usually managed to get the better of him by dressing itself up as guilt and self loathing in which guise it could throw him right out of the ring  
  
  credulous and rich just so that he could pay off some perhaps even just one of the more prominent and sensational bills he lit a cigarette the smoke curled upwards in the morning light and attached itself to the ceiling  
  
  like that chap yesterday    
  
  he paused  
  
  the chap yesterday     
  
  the world held its breath  
  
  quietly and gently there settled on him the knowledge that something somewhere was ghastly something was terribly wrong  
  
  there was a disaster hanging silently in the air around him waiting for him to notice it his knees tingled  
  
  what he needed he had been thinking was a client he had been thinking that as a matter of habit it was what he always thought at this time of the morning what he had forgotten was that he had one  
  
  he stared wildly at his watch nearly eleventhirty he shook his head to try and clear the silent ringing between his ears then made a hysterical lunge for his hat and his great leather coat that hung behind the door  
  
  fifteen seconds later he left the house five hours late but moving fast  
  
chapter   
  
   a minute or two later dirk paused to consider his best strategy rather than arrive five hours late and flustered it would be better all round if he were to arrive five hours and a few extra minutes late but triumphantly in command  
  
   pray god i am not too soon would be a good opening line as he swept in but it needed a good followthrough as well and he wasnt sure what it should be  
  
   perhaps it would save time if he went back to get his car but then again it was only a short distance and he had a tremendous propensity for getting lost when driving this was largely because of his method of zen navigation which was simply to find any car that looked as if it knew where it was going and follow it the results were more often surprising than successful but he felt it was worth it for the sake of the few occasions when it was both  
  
   furthermore he was not at all certain that his car was working  
  
   it was an elderly jaguar built at that very special time in the companys history when they were making cars which had to stop for repairs more often than they needed to stop for petrol and frequently needed to rest for months between outings he was however certain now that he came to think about it that the car didnt have any petrol and furthermore he did not have any cash or valid plastic to enable him to fill it up  
  
   he abandoned that line of thought as wholly fruitless  
  
   he stopped to buy a newspaper while he thought things over the clock in the newsagents said eleven thirtyfive damn damn damn he toyed with the idea of simply dropping the case just walking away and forgetting about it having some lunch the whole thing was fraught with difficulties in any event or rather it was fraught with one particular difficulty which was that of keeping a straight face the whole thing was complete and utter nonsense the client was clearly loopy and dirk would not have considered taking the case except for one very important thing  
  
   three hundred pounds a day plus expenses  
  
   the client had agreed to it just like that and when dirk had started his usual speech to the effect that his methods involving as they did the fundamental interconnectedness of all things often led to expenses that might appear to the untutored eye to be somewhat tangential to the matter in hand the client had simply waved the matter aside as trifling dirk liked that in a client  
  
   the only thing the client had insisted upon in the midst of this almost superhuman fit of reasonableness was that dirk had to be there absolutely had had had to be there ready functioning and alert without fail without even the merest smidgen of an inkling of failure at sixthirty in the morning absolute  
  
   well he was just going to have to see reason about that as well sixthirty was clearly a preposterous time and he the client obviously hadnt meant it seriously a civilized sixthirty for twelve noon was almost certainly what he had in mind and if he wanted to cut up rough about it dirk would have no option but to start handing out some serious statistics nobody got murdered before lunch but nobody people werent up to it you needed a good lunch to get both the bloodsugar and bloodlust levels up dirk had the figures to prove it  
  
   did he anstey the clients name was anstey an odd intense man in his midthirties with staring eyes a narrow yellow tie and one of the big houses in lupton road dirk hadnt actually liked him very much and thought he looked as if he was trying to swallow a fish did he know that  per cent of all known murderers who expressed a preference had had liver and bacon for lunch and that another  per cent had been torn between either a prawn biryani or an omelette that dispensed with  per cent of the threat at a stroke and by the time you had further discounted the salad eaters and the turkey and ham sandwich munchers and started to look at the number of people who would contemplate such a course of action without any lunch at all then you were well into the realms of negligibility and bordering on fantasy  
  
   after twothirty but nearer to three oclock was when you had to start being on your guard seriously even on good days even when you werent receiving death threats from strange gigantic men with green eyes you had to watch people like a hawk after the lunching hour the really dangerous time was after four oclockish when the streets began to fill up with marauding packs of publishers and agents maddened with fettucine and kir and baying for cabs those were the times that tested mens souls sixthirty in the morning forget it dirk had  
  
   with his resolve wellstiffened dirk stepped back out of the newsagents into the nippy air of the street and strode off  
  
   ah i expect youll be wanting to pay for that paper then wont you mr dirk sir said the newsagent trotting gently after him  
  
   ah bates said  dirk loftily you and your expectations always expecting this and expecting that may i recommend serenity to you a life that is burdened with expectations is a heavy life its fruit is sorrow and disappointment learn to be one with the joy of the moment  
  
   i think its twenty pence that one sir said bates tranquilly  
  
   tell you what ill do bates seeing as its you do you have a pen on you at all a simple ballpoint will suffice  
  
   bates produced one from an inner pocket and handed it to dirk who then tore off the corner of the paper on which the price was printed and scribbled iou above it he handed the scrap of paper to the newsagent  
  
   shall i put this with the others then sir  
  
   put it wherever it will give you the greatest joy dear bates i would want you to put it nowhere less for now dear man farewell  
  
   i expect youll be wanting to give me back my pen as well mr dirk  
  
   when the times are propitious for such a transaction my dear bates said dirk you may depend upon it for the moment higher purposes call it joy bates great joy bates please let go of it  
  
   after one last listless tug the little man shrugged and padded back towards his shop  
  
   i expect ill be seeing you later then mr dirk he called out over his shoulder without enthusiasm  
  
   dirk gave a gracious bow of his head to the mans retreating back and then hurried on opening the newspaper at the horoscope page as he did so  
  
   virtually everything you decide today will be wrong it said bluntly  
  
   dirk slapped the paper shut with a grunt he did not for a second hold with the notion that great whirling lumps of rock light years away knew something about your day that you didnt it just so happened that the great zaganza was an old friend of his who knew when dirks birthday was and always wrote his column deliberately to wind him up the papers circulation had dropped by nearly a twelfth since he had taken over doing the horoscope and only dirk and the great zaganza knew why  
  
   he hurried on flapping his way quickly through the rest of the paper as usual there was nothing interesting a lot of stuff about the search for janice smith the missing airline girl from heathrow and how she could possibly have disappeared just like that they printed the latest picture of her which was on a swing with pigtails aged six her father a mr jim pearce was quoted as saying it was quite a good likeness but she had grown up a lot now and was usually in better focus impatiently dirk tucked the paper under his arm and strode onwards his thoughts on a much more interesting topic  
  
   three hundred pounds a day plus expenses  
  
   he wondered how long he could reasonably expect to sustain in mr anstey his strange delusions that he was about to be murdered by a seven foot tall shaggyhaired creature with huge green eyes and horns who habitually waved things at him a contract written in some incomprehensible language and signed with a splash of blood and also a kind of scythe the other notable feature of this creature was that no one other than his client had been able to see it which mr anstey dismissed as a trick of the light  
  
   three days four dirk didnt think hed be able to manage a whole week with a straight face but he was already looking at something like a grand for his trouble and he would stick a new fridge down on the list of tangential but nonnegotiable expenses that would be a good one getting the old fridge thrown out was definitely part of the interconnectedness of all things  
  
   he began to whistle at the thought of simply getting someone to come round and cart the thing away turned into lupton road and was surprised at all the police cars there and the ambulance he didnt like them being there it didnt feel right it didnt sit comfortably in his mind alongside his visions of a new fridge  
  
chapter   
  
   
   dirk knew lupton road it was a wide treelined affair with large latevictorian terraces which stood tall and sturdily and resented police cars resented them if they tuned up in numbers that is and if their lights were flashing the inhabitants of lupton road liked to see a nice wellturnedout single police car patrolling up and down the street in a cheerful and robust manner  it kept property values cheerful and robust too but the moment the lights started flashing in that knucklewhitening blue they cast their pallor not only on the neatly pointed bricks that they flashed across but also on the very values those bricks represented  
  
   anxious faces peered from behind the glass of neighbouring windows and were irradiated by the blue strobes  
  
   there were three of them three police cars left askew across the road in a way that transcended mere parking it sent out a massive signal to the world saying that the law was here now taking charge of things and that anyone who just had normal good and cheerful business to conduct in lupton road could just fuck off  
  
   dirk hurried up the road sweat pricking at him beneath his heavy leather coat a police constable loomed up ahead of him with his arms spread out playing at being a stop barrier but dirk swept him aside in a torrent of words to which the constable was unable to come up with a good response off the top of his head dirk sped on to the house  
  
   at the door another policeman stopped him and dirk was about to wave an expired marks and spencer charge card at him with a deft little flick of the wrist that he had practiced for hours in front of a mirror on those long evenings when nothing much else was on when the officer suddenly said hey is your name gently  
  
   dirk blinked at him warily he made a slight grunting noise that could be either yes or no depending on the circumstances  
  
   because the chief has been looking for you  
  
   has he said dirk  
  
   i recognised you from his description said the officer looking him up and down with a slight smirk  
  
   in fact continued the officer hes been using your name in a manner that some might find highly offensive he even sent big bob the finder off in a car to find you i can tell that he didnt find you from the fact that youre looking reasonably well lot of people get found by big bob the finder they come in a bit wobbly just about able to help us with our enquiries but thats about all youd better go in rather you than me he added quietly  
  
   dirk glanced at the house the strippedpine shutters were closed across all the windows though in all other respects the house seemed well cared for groomed into a state of clean wellpointed affluence the closed shutters seemed to convey an air of sudden devastation  
  
   oddly there seemed to be music coming from the basement or rather just a single disjointed phrase of thumping music being repeated over and over again it sounded as if the stylus had got stuck in the groove of a record and dirk wondered why no one had turned it off or at least nudged the stylus along so that the record could continue the song seemed very vaguely familiar and dirk guessed that he had probably heard it on the radio recently though he couldnt place it the fragment of lyric seemed to be something like  
  
   
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i   and so on  
  
   
  
   youll be wanting to go down to the basement said the officer impassively as if that was the last thing that anyone in their right mind would be wanting to do  
  
   dirk nodded to him curtly and hurried up the steps to the front door which was standing slightly ajar he shook his head and clenched his shoulders to try and stop his brain fluttering  
  
   he went in  
  
   the hallway spoke of prosperity imposed on a taste that had originally been formed by student living the floors were stripped boards heavily polyurethaned the walls white with greek rugs hung on them but expensive greek rugs dirk would be prepared to bet though probably not to pay up that a thorough search of the house would reveal amongst who knew what other dark secrets five hundred british telecom shares and a set of dylan albums that was complete up to blood on the tracks  
  
   another policeman was standing in the hall he looked terribly young and he was leaning very slightly back against the wall staring at the floor and holding his helmet against his stomach his face was pale and shiny he looked at dirk blankly and nodded faintly in the direction of the stairs leading down  
  
   up the stairs came the repeated sound  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dirk was trembling with a rage that was barging around inside him looking for something to hit or throttle he wished that he could hotly deny that any of this was his fault but until anybody tried to assert that it was he couldnt  
  
   how long have you been here he said curtly  
  
   the young policeman had to gather himself together to answer  
  
   we arrived about halfhour ago he replied in a thick voice hell of a morning rushing around  
  
   don’t tell me about rushing around said dirk completely meaninglessly he launched himself down the stars  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   at the bottom there was a narrow corridor the main door off it was heavily cracked and hanging off its hinges it opened into a large double room dirk was about to enter when a figure emerged from it and stood barring his way  
  
   i hate the fact that this case has got you mixed up in it said the figure i hate it very much tell me what youve got to do with it so i know exactly what it is im hating  
  
   dirk stared at the neat thin face in astonishment  
  
   gilks he said  
  
   dont stand there looking like a startled whatsisname what are those things what arent seals much worse than seals big blubbery things dugongs dont stand there looking like a startled dugong why has that gilks pointed into the room behind him why has that  man in there got your name and telephone number on an envelope full of money  
  
   how m started dirk how may i ask do you come to be here gilks what are you doing so far from the fens surprised you find it dank enough for you here  
  
   three hundred pounds said gilks why  
  
   perhaps you would allow me to speak to my client said dirk  
  
   your client eh said gilks grimly yes all right why dont you speak to him id be interested to hear what you have to say he stood back stiffly and waved dirk into the room  
  
   dirk gathered his thoughts and entered the room in a state of controlled composure which lasted for just over a second  
  
   most of his client was sitting quietly in a comfortable chair in front of the hifi the chair was placed in the optimal listening position  about twice as far back from the speakers as the distance between them which is generally considered to be ideal for stereo imaging  
  
   he seemed generally to be casual and relaxed with his legs crossed and a halffinished cup of coffee on the small table beside him distressingly though his head was sitting neatly on the middle of the record which was revolving on the hifi turntable with the tone arm snuggling up against the neck and constantly being deflected back into the same groove as the head revolved it seemed once every  seconds or so to shoot dirk a reproachful glance as if to say see what happens when you dont turn up on time like i asked you to then it would sweep on round to the wall round round and back to the front again with more reproach  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   the room swayed a little around dirk and he put his hand out against the wall to steady it  
  
   was there any particular service you were engaged to provide for your client said gilks behind him very quietly  
  
   oh er just a small matter said dirk weakly nothing connected with all this no he er didnt mention any of this kind of thing at all well look i can see youre busy i think id better just collect my fee and leave you say he left it out for me  
  
   having said this dirk sat heavily on a small bentwood chair standing behind him and broke it  
  
   gilks hauled him back to his feet again and propped him against the wall briefly he left the room then came back with a small jug of water and a glass on a tray he poured some water into the glass took it to dirk and threw it at him  
  
   better  
  
   no spluttered dirk cant you at least turn the record off  
  
   that’s forensics’ job cant touch anything till the clever dicks have been maybe thats them now go out on to the patio and get some air chain yourself to the railing and beat yourself up a little im pushed for time myself and try to look less green will you its not your colour  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   gilks turned round looking tired and cross and was about to go out and up the stairs to meet the newcomers whose voices could be heard up on the ground floor when he paused and watched the head revolving patiently on its heavy platter for a few seconds  
  
   you know he said at last these smartalec showoff suicides really make me tired they only do it to annoy  
  
   suicide said dirk  
  
   gilks glanced round at him  
  
   windows secured with iron bars half an inch thick he said door locked from the inside with the key still in the lock furniture piled against the inside of the door french windows to the patio locked with mortise door bolts no signs of a tunnel if it was murder then the murderer must have stopped to do a damn fine job of glazing on the way out except that all the puttys old and painted over  
  
   no nobodys left this room and nobodys broken into it except for us and im pretty sure we didnt do it  
  
   i havent time to fiddle around on this one obviously suicide and just done to be difficult ive half a mind to do the deceased for wasting police time tell you what he said glancing at his watch youve got ten minutes if you come up with a plausible explanation of how he did it that i can put in my report ill let you keep the evidence in the envelope minus  per cent compensation to me for the emotional wear and tear involved in not punching you in the mouth  
  
   dirk wondered for a moment whether or not to mention the visits his client claimed to have received from a strange and violent greeneyed furclad giant who regularly emerged out of nowhere bellowing about contracts and obligations and waving a threefoot glitteringedged scythe but decided on balance no  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   he was seething at himself at last he had not been able to seethe at himself properly over the death of his client because it was too huge and horrific a burden to bear but now he had been humiliated by gilks and found himself in too wobbly and disturbed a state to fight back so he was able to seethe at himself about that  
  
   he turned sharply away from his tormentor and let himself out into the patio garden to be alone with his seethings  
  
   the patio was a small paved westfacing area at the rear which was largely deprived of light cut off as it was by the high back wall of the house and by the high wall of some industrial building that backed on to the rear in the middle of it stood for who knew what possible reason a stone sundial if any light at all fell on the sundial you would know that it was pretty close to noon gmt other than that birds perched on it a few plants sulked in pots  
  
   dirk jabbed a cigarette in his mouth and burnt a lot of the end of it fiercely  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i still nagged from inside the house  
  
   neat garden walls separated the patio on either side from the gardens of neighbouring houses the one to the left was the same size as this one the one to the right extended a little further benefiting from the fact that the industrial building finished flush with the intervening garden wall there was an air of wellkemptness nothing grand nothing flashy just a sense that all was well and that upkeep on the houses was no problem the house to the right in particular looked as if it had had its brickwork repointed quite recently and its windows reglossed  
  
   dirk took a large gulp of air and stood for a second staring up into what could be seen of the sky which was grey and hazy a single dark speck was wheeling against the underside of the clouds dirk watched this for a while glad of any focus for his thoughts other than the horrors of the room he had just left he was vaguely aware of comings and goings within the room of a certain amount of tapemeasuring happening of a feeling that photographs were being taken and that severedheadremoval activities were taking place  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dont pick it up pick it up pick i  
  
   dont pi    
  
 somebody at last picked it up the nagging repetition was at last hushed and now the gentle sound of a distant television floated peacefully on the noontime air  
  
   dirk however was having a great deal of difficulty in taking it all in he was much more aware of taking a succession of huge swimmy whacks to the head which were the assaults of guilt it was not the normal backgroundnoise type of guilt that comes from just being alive this far into the twentieth century and which dirk was usually fairly adept at dealing with it was an actual stunning sense of this specific terrible thing is specifically and terribly my fault all the normal mental moves wouldnt let him get out of the path of the huge pendulum  
  
   wham it came again whizz wham again and again  
  
   wham  
  
   wham wham  
  
   he tried to remember any of the details of what his late client wham wham had said wham to him wham but it was wham virtually impossible wham with all this whamming taking place wham the man had said wham that dirk took a deep breath wham he was being pursued wham by wham a large hairy greeneyed monster armed with a scythe  
  
   
  
   wham  
  
   dirk had secretly smiled to himself about this  
  
   whim wham whim wham whim wham  
  
   and had thought what a silly man  
  
   whim whim whim whim wham  
  
   a scythe whom and a contract wham  
  
   
  
   he hadnt known or even had the faintest idea as to what the contract was for  
  
   of course dirk had thought wham  
  
   but he had a vague feeling that it might have something to do with a potato there was a bit of a complicated story attached to that whim whim whim  
  
   dirk had nodded seriously at this point wham and made a reassuring tick wham on a pad which he kept on his desk wham for the express purpose of making reassuring ticks on wham wham wham he had prided himself at that moment on having managed to convey the impression that he had made a tick in a small box marked potatoes  
  
   wham wham wham wham  
  
   mr anstey had said he would explain further about the potatoes when dirk arrived to carry out his task  
  
   and dirk had promised whom easily wham casually wham with an airy wave of his hand wham wham wham to be there at sixthirty in the morning wham because the contract wham fell due at seven oclock  
  
   dirk remembered having made another tick in a notional potato contract falls due at  am box wh  
  
   he couldnt handle all this whamming any more he couldnt blame himself for what had happened well he could of course he could he did it was in fact his fault wham the point was that he couldnt continue to blame himself for what had happened and think clearly about it which he was going to have to do he would have to dig this horrible thing wham up by the roots and if he was going to be fit to do that he had somehow to divest himself wham of this whamming  
  
   a huge wave of anger surged over him as he contemplated his predicament and the tangled distress of his life he hated this neat patio he hated all this sundial stuff and all these neatly painted windows all these hideously trim roofs he wanted to blame it all on the paintwork rather than on himself on the revoltingly tidy patio paving stones on the sheer disgusting abomination of the neatly repointed brickwork  
  
   excuse me  
  
   what  he whirled round caught unawares by this intrusion into his private raging of a quiet polite voice  
  
   are you connected with the woman indicated all the unpleasantness and the lowergroundfloorness and the horrible sort of policeness of things next door to her with a little floating movement of her wrist her wrist wore a red bracelet which matched the frames of her glasses she was looking over the garden wall from the house on the right with an air of slightly anxious distaste  
  
   dirk glared at her speechlessly she looked about forty somethingish and neat with an instant and unmistakable quality of advertising about her  
  
   she gave a troubled sigh  
  
   i know its probably all very terrible and everything she said but do you think it will take long we only called in the police because the noise of that ghastly record was driving us up the wall its all a bit  
  
   she gave him a look of silent appeal and dirk decided that it could all be her fault she could as far as he was concerned take the blame for everything while he sorted it out she deserved it if only for wearing a bracelet like that  
  
   without a word he turned his back on her and took his fury back inside the house where it began rapidly to freeze into something hard and efficient  
  
   gilks he said your smartalec suicide theory i like it it works for me and i think i see how the clever bastard pulled it off bring me pen bring me paper  
  
   he sat down with a flourish at the cherrywood farmhouse table which occupied the centre of the rear portion of the room and deftly sketched out a scheme of events which involved a number of household or kitchen implements a swinging weighted light fitting some very precise timing and hinged on the vital fact that the record turntable was japanese  
  
   that should keep your forensic chaps happy said dirk briskly to gilks the forensic chaps glanced at it took in its salient points and liked them they were simple implausible and of exactly that nature which a coroner who liked the same sort of holidays in marbella which they did would be sure to relish  
  
   unless said dirk casually you are interested in the notion that the deceased had entered into some kind of diabolical contract with a supernatural agency for which payment was now being exacted  
  
   the forensic chaps glanced at each other and shook their heads there was a strong sense from them that the morning was wearing on and that this kind of talk was only introducing unnecessary complications into a case which otherwise could be well behind them before lunch  
  
   dirk made a satisfied shrug peeled off his share of the evidence and with a final nod to the constabulary made his way back upstairs  
  
   as he reached the hallway it suddenly became apparent to him that the gentle sounds of daytime television which he had heard from out in the garden had previously been masked from inside by the insistent sound of the record stuck in its groove  
  
   he was surprised now to realise that they were in fact coming from somewhere upstairs in this house with a quick look round to see that he was not observed he stood on the bottom step of the staircase leading to the upstairs floors of the house and glanced up them in surprise  
  
chapter   
  
   the stairs were carpeted with a tastefully austere matting type of substance dirk quietly made his way up them past some tastefully dried large things in a pot that stood on the first landing and looked into the rooms on the first floor they too were tasteful and dried  
  
   the larger of the two bedrooms was the only one that showed any signs of current use it had clearly been designed to allow the morning light to play on delicately arranged flowers and duvets stuffed with something like hay but there was a feeling that socks and used shaving heads were instead beginning to gather the room into their grip there was a distinct absence of anything female in the room  the same sort of absence that a missing picture leaves behind it on a wall there was an air of tension and of sadness and of things needing to be cleaned out from under the bed  
  
   the bathroom which opened out from it had a gold disc hung on the wall in front of the lavatory for sales of five hundred thousand copies of a record called hot potato by a band called pugilism and the third autistic cuckoo dirk had a vague recollection of having read part of an interview with the leader of the band there were only two of them and one of them was the leader in a sunday paper he had been asked about their name and he had said that there was an interesting story about it though it turned out not to be it can mean whatever people wantit to mean he had added with a shrug from the sofa of his managers office somewhere off oxford street  
  
   dirk remembered visualizing the journalist nodding politely and writing this down a vile knot had formed in dirks stomach which he had eventually softened with gin  
  
   hot potato  thought dirk it suddenly occurred to him looking at the gold disc hanging in its red frame that the record on which the late mr ansteys head had been perched was obviously this one hot potato dont pick it up  
  
   what could that mean  
  
   whatever people wanted it to mean dirk thought with bed grace  
  
   the other thing that he remembered now about the interview was that pain the leader of pugilism and the third autistic cuckoo was called pain claimed to have written the lyrics down more or less verbatim from a conversation which he or somebody had overheard in a cafe or a sauna or an aeroplane or something like that dirk wondered how the originators of the conversation would feel to hear their words being repeated in the circumstances in which he had just heard them  
  
   he peered more closely at the label in the centre of the gold record at the top of the label it said simply arrgh while underneath the actual title were the writers credits  paignton mulville anstey  
  
   mulville was presumably the member of pugilism and the third autistic cuckoo who wasnt the leader and geoff ansteys inclusion on the writing credits of a majorselling single was probably what had paid for this house when anstey had talked about the contract having something to do with potato he had assumed that dirk knew what he meant and he dirk had as easily assumed that anstey was blithering it was very easy to assume that someone who was talking about greeneyed monsters with scythes was also blithering when he talked about potatoes  
  
   dirk sighed to himself with deep uneasiness he took a dislike to the neat way the trophy was hanging on the wall and adjusted it a little so that it hung at a more humane and untidy angle doing this caused an envelope to fall out from behind the frame and flutter towards the floor dirk tried unsuccessfully to catch it with an unfit grunt he bent over and picked the thing up  
  
   it was a largish cream envelope of rich heavy paper roughly slit open at one end and resealed with sellotape in fact it looked as if it had been opened and resealed with fresh layers of tape many times an impression which was borne out by the number of names to which the envelope had in its time been addressed  each successively crossed out and replaced by another  
  
   the last name on it was that of geoff anstey at least dirk assumed it was the last name because it was the only one that had not been crossed out and crossed out heavily dirk peered at some of the other names trying to make them out  
  
   some memory was stirred by a couple of the names which he could just about discern but he needed to examine the envelope much more closely he had been meaning to buy himself a magnifying glass ever since he had become a detective but had never got around to it he also did not possess a penknife so reluctantly he decided that the most prudent course was to tuck the envelope away for the moment in one of the deeper recesses of his coat and examine it later in privacy  
  
   he glanced quickly behind the frame of the gold disc to see if any other goodies might emerge but was disappointed and so he quit the bathroom and resumed his exploration of the house  
  
   the other bedroom was neat and soulless unused a pine bed a duvet and an old battered chest of drawers that had been revived by being plunged into a vat of acid were its main features dirk pulled the door of it closed behind him and started to ascend the small wobbly whitepainted stairway that led up to an attic from which the sounds of bugs bunny could be heard  
  
   at the top of the stairs was a minute landing which opened on one side into a bathroom so small that it would best be used by standing outside and sticking into it whichever limb you wanted to wash the door to it was kept ajar by a length of green hosepipe which trailed from the cold tap of the washbasin out of the bathroom across the landing and into the only other room here at the top of the house  
  
   it was an attic room with a severely pitched roof which offered only a few spots where a person of anything approaching average height could stand up  
  
   dirk stood hunched in the doorway and surveyed its contents nervous of what he might find amongst them there was a general grunginess about the place the curtains were closed and little light made it past them into the room which was otherwise illuminated only by the flickering glow of an animated rabbit an unmade bed with dank screwedup sheets was pushed under a particularly low angle of the ceiling part of the walls and the more nearly vertical surfaces of the ceiling were covered with pictures crudely cut out of magazines  
  
   there didnt seem to be any common theme or purpose behind the cuttings as well as a couple of pictures of flashy german cars and the odd bra advertisement there were also a badly torn picture of a fruit flan part of an advertisement for life insurance and other random fragments which suggested they had been selected and arranged with a dull bovine indifference to any meaning that any of them might have or effect they might achieve  
  
   the hosepipe curled across the floor and led around the side of an elderly armchair pulled up in front of the television set  
  
   the rabbit rampaged the glow of his rampagings played on the frayed edges of the armchair bugs was wrestling with the controls of an aeroplane which was plunging to the ground suddenly he saw a button marked autopilot and pressed it a cupboard opened and a robot pilot clambered out took one look at the situation and baled out the plane hurtled on towards the ground but luckily ran out of fuel just before reaching it and so the rabbit was saved  
  
   dirk could also see the top of a head  
  
   the hair of this head was dark matted and greasy dirk watched it for a long uneasy moment before advancing slowly into the room to see what if anything it was attached to his relief at discovering as he rounded the armchair that the head was after all attached to a living body was a little marred by the sight of the living body to which it was attached  
  
   slumped in the armchair was a boy  
  
   he was probably about thirteen or fourteen and although he didnt look ill in any specific physical way he was definitely not a well person his hair sagged on his head his head sagged on his shoulders and he lay in the armchair in a sort of limp crumpled way as if hed been hurled there from a passing train he was dressed merely in a cheap leather jacket and sleepingbag  
  
   dirk stared at him  
  
   who was he what was a boy doing here watching television in a house where someone had just been decapitated did he know what had happened did gilks know about him had gilks even bothered to come up here it was after all several flights of stairs for a busy policeman with a tricky suicide on his hands  
  
   after dirk had been standing there for twenty seconds or so the boys eyes climbed up towards him failed utterly to acknowledge him in any way at all and then dropped again and locked back on to the rabbit  
  
   dirk was unused to making quite such a minuscule impact on anybody he checked to be sure that he did have his huge leather coat and his absurd red hat on and that he was properly and dramatically silhouetted by the light of the doorway  
  
   he felt momentarily deflated and said er  by way of self introduction but it didnt get the boys attention he didnt like this the kid was deliberately and maliciously watching television at him he frowned there was a kind of steamy tension building in the room it seemed to dirk a kind of difficult hissing quality to the whole air of the place which he did not know how to respond to it rose in intensity and then suddenly ended with an abrupt click which made dirk start  
  
   the boy unwound himself like a slow fat snake leaned sideways over the far side of the armchair and made some elaborate unseen preparations which clearly involved as dirk now realised an electric kettle when he resumed his earlier splayed posture it was with the addition of a plastic pot clutched in his right hand from which he forked rubbery strands of steaming gunk into his mouth  
  
   the rabbit brought his affairs to a conclusion and gave way to a jeering comedian who wished the viewers to buy a certain brand of lager on the basis of nothing better than his own hardly disinterested sayso  
  
   dirk felt that it was time to make a slightly greater impression on the proceedings than he had so far managed to do he stepped forward directly into the boys line of sight  
  
   kid dirk said in a tone that he hoped would sound firm but gentle and not in any way at all patronising or affected or gauche i need to know who    
  
   he was distracted at that moment by the sight which met him from the new position in which he was standing on the other side of the armchair there was a large half full cateringsize box of pot noodles a large half full cateringsize box of mars bars a half demolished pyramid of cans of soft drink and the end of the hosepipe the hosepipe ended in a plastic tap nozzle and was obviously used for refilling the kettle  
  
   dirk had simply been going to ask the boy who he was but seen from this angle the family resemblance was unmistakable he was clearly the son of the lately decapitated geoffrey anstey perhaps this behaviour was just his way of dealing with shock or perhaps he really didnt know what had happened or perhaps he  
  
   dirk hardly liked to think  
  
   in fact he was finding it hard to think clearly while the television beside him was on behalf of a toothpaste manufacturing company trying to worry him deeply about some of the things which might be going on in his mouth  
  
   ok he said i dont like to disturb you at what i know must be a difficult and distressing time for you but i need to know first of all if you actually realise that this is a difficult and distressing time for you  
  
   nothing  
  
   all right thought dirk time for a little judicious toughness he leant back against the wall stuck his hands in his pockets in an okifthatsthewayyouwanttoplayit manner stared moodily at the floor for a few seconds then swung his head up and let the boy have a hard look right between the eyes  
  
   i have to tell you kid he said tersely your fathers dead  
  
   this might have worked if it hadnt been for a very popular and longrunning commercial which started at that moment it seemed to dirk to be a particularly astounding example of the genre  
  
   the opening sequence showed the angel lucifer being hurled from heaven into the pit of hell where he then lay on a bumming lake until a passing demon aimed and gave him a can of a fizzy soft drink called shades lucifer took it and tried it he greedily guzzled the whole contents of the can and then turned to camera slipped on some porsche design sunglasses said now were really cookin and lay back basking in the glow of the burning coals being heaped around him  
  
   at that point an impossibly deep and growly american voice which sounded as if it had itself crawled from the pit of hel or at least from a soho basement drinking club to which it was keen to return as soon as possible to marinade itself into shape for the next voiceover said shades the drink from hell  and the can revolved a little to obscure the initial s and thus spell hades  
  
   the theology of this seemed a little confused reflected dirk but what was one tiny extra droplet of misinformation in such a raging torrent  
  
   lucifer then mugged at the camera again and said i could really fall for this stuff  and just in case the viewer had been rendered completely insensate by all these goingson the opening shot of lucifer being hurled from heaven was briefly replayed in order to emphasize the word fall  
  
   the boys attention was entirely captivated by this  
  
   dirk squatted down in between the boy and the screen  
  
   listen to me he began  
  
   the boy craned his neck round to look past dirk at the screen he had to redistribute his limbs in the chair in order to be able to do this and continue to fork pot noodle into himself  
  
   listen insisted dirk again  
  
   dirk felt he was beginning to be in serious danger of losing the upper hand in the situation it wasnt merely that the boys attention was on the television it was that nothing else seemed to have any meaning or independent existence for him at all dirk was merely a featureless object in the way of the television the boy seemed to bear him no malice he merely wished to see past him  
  
   look can we turn this off for a moment dirk said and he tried not to make it sound testy  
  
   the boy did not respond maybe there was a slight stiffening of the shoulders maybe it was a shrug dirk turned around and was at a loss to find which button to push to turn the television off the whole control pane seemed to be dedicated to the single purpose of keeping itself turned on  there was no single button marked on or off eventually dirk simply disconnected the set from the power socket on the wall and turned back to the boy who broke his nose  
  
   dirk felt his septum crunching from the terrific impact of the boys forehead as they both toppled heavily backwards against the set but the noise of the bone breaking and the noise of his own cry of pain as it broke was completely obliterated by the howling screams of rage that erupted from the boys throat dirk flailed helplessly to try and protect himself from the fury of the onslaught but the boy was on top with his elbow in dirks eye his knees pounding first on dirks ribcage then his jaw and then on dirks already traumatized nose as he scrambled over him to reconnect the power to the television he then settled back comfortably into the armchair and watched with a moody and unsettled eye as the picture reassembled itself  
  
   you could at least have waited for the news he said in a dull voice  
  
   dirk gaped at him he sat huddled on the floor coddling his bleeding nose in his hands and gaped at the monstrously disinterested creature  
  
   whhfff   fffmmm   nnggh   he protested and then gave up for the time being while he probed his nose for the damage  
  
   there was definitely a wobbly bit that clicked nastily between his fingers and the whole thing seemed suddenly to be a horribly unfamiliar shape he fished a handkerchief out of his pocket and held it up to his face blood spread easily through it  he staggered to his feet brushed aside nonexistent offers of help stomped out of the room and into the tiny bathroom there he yanked the hosepipe angrily off the tap found a towel soaked it in cold water and held it to his face for a minute or two until the flow of blood gradually slowed to a trickle and stopped he stared at himself in the mirror his nose was quite definitely leaning at a slightly rakish angle he tried bravely to shift it but not bravely enough it hurt abominably so he contented himself with dabbing at it a little more with the wet towel and swearing quietly  
  
   then he stood there for a second or two longer leaning against the basin breathing heavily and practicing saying all right fiercely into the mirror it came out as awwbwigh and lacked any real authority when he felt sufficiently braced or at least as braced as he was likely to feel in the immediate future he turned and stalked grimly back into the den of the beast  
  
   the beast was sitting quietly absorbing news of some of the exciting and stimulating game shows that the evening held in store for the determined viewer and did not look up as dirk reentered  
  
   dirk walked briskly over to the window and drew the curtains sharply back half hoping that the beast might shrivel up shrieking if exposed to daylight but other than wrinkling up its nose it did not react a dark shadow flapped briefly across the window but the angle was such that dirk could not see what caused it  
  
   he turned and faced the boybeast the midday news bulletin was starting on television and the boy seemed somehow a little more open a little more receptive to the world outside the flickering coloured rectangle he glanced up at dirk with a sour tired look  
  
   whaddayawananyway he said  
  
   i ted you whad i wad said dirk fiercely but hopelessly i wadhag od a bobedi gnow thad faith  
  
   dirks attention had switched suddenly to the television screen where a rather more uptodate photograph of the missing airline checkin girl was being shown  
  
   whadayadoingere said the boy  
  
   jjchhhhh said dirk and perched himself down on the arm of the chair peering intently at the face on the screen it had been taken about a year ago before the girl had learnt about corporate lipgloss she had frizzy hair and a frumpy putupon look  
  
   whoareyou wassgoinon insisted the boy  
  
   loog  chuddub snapped dirk ib tryid to wodge dthith  
  
   the newscaster said that the police professed themselves to be mystified by the fact that there was no trace of janice smith at the scene of the incident they explained that there was a limit to the number of times they could search the same buildings and appealed for anyone who might have a clue as to her whereabouts to come forward  
  
   thadth by segradry thadth mith pearth exclaimed dirk in astonishment  
  
   the boy was not interested in dirks exsecretary and gave up trying to attract dirks attention he wriggled out of the sleepingbag and sloped off to the bathroom  
  
   dirk sat staring at the television bewildered that he hadnt realised before who the missing girl was still there was no reason why he should have done he realized marriage had changed her name and this was the first time they had shown a photograph that actually identified her so far he had taken no real interest in the strange incident at the airport but now it demanded his attention  
  
   the explosion was now officially designated an act of god  
  
   but thought dirk what god and why  
  
   what god would be hanging around terminal two of heathrow airport trying to catch the  flight to oslo  
  
   after the miserable lassitude of the last few weeks he suddenly had a great deal that required his immediate attention he frowned in deep thought for a few moments and hardly noticed when the beastboy snuck back in and snuggled back into his sleepingbag just in time for the advertisements to start the first one showed how a perfectly ordinary stock cube could form the natural focus of a normal happy family life  
  
   dirk leapt to his feet but even as he was about to start questioning the boy again his heart sank as he looked at him the beast was far away sunk back in his dark flickering lair and dirk did not feel inclined to disturb him again at the moment  
  
   he contented himself with barking at the unresponding child that he would be back and bustled heavily down the stairs his big leather coat flapping madly behind him  
  
   in the hallway he encountered the loathed gilks once more  
  
   what happened to you said the policeman sharply catching sight of dirks bruised and bulging nose  
  
   ondly whad you dold me said dirk innocently i bead bythelf ub  
  
   gilks demanded to know what he had been doing and dirk generously explained that there was a witness upstairs with some interesting information to impart he suggested that gilks go and have a word with him but that it would be best if he turned off the television first  
  
   gilks nodded curtly he started to go up the stairs but dirk stopped him  
  
   doedth eddydthig dthrike you adth dthraydge aboud dthidth houdth he said  
  
   what did you say said gilks in irritation  
  
   subbthig dthraydge said dirk  
  
   something what  
  
   dthraydge insisted dirk  
  
   strange  
  
   dthadth right dthraydge  
  
   gilks shrugged like what he said  
  
   id dtheemdth to be cobbleedly dthouledth  
  
   completely what  
  
   dthouledth  he tried again thoulleth i dthigg dthadth dverry idderedthigg  
  
   with that he doffed his hat politely and swept on out of the house and up the street where an eagle swooped out of the sky at him and came within a whisker of causing him to fall under a  bus on its way south for the next twenty minutes hideous yells and screams emanated from the top floor of the house in lupton road and caused much tension among the neighbours the ambulance took away the upper and lower remains of mr anstey and also a policeman with a bleeding face for a short while after this there was quietness  
  
   then another police car drew up outside the house a lot o bobs here type of remarks floated from the house as an extremely large and burly policeman heaved himself out of the car and bustled up the steps a few minutes and a great deal of screaming and yelling later he reemerged also clutching his face and drove off in deep dudgeon squealing his tires in a violent and unnecessary manner  
  
   twenty minutes later a van arrived from which emerged another policeman carrying a tiny pocket television set he entered the house and reemerged a short while later leading a docile thirteenyearold boy who was content with his new toy  
  
   once all policemen had departed save for the single squad car which remained parked outside to keep watch on the house a large hairy greeneyed figure emerged from its hiding place behind one of the molecules in the large basement room  
  
   it propped its scythe against one of the hifi speakers dipped a long gnarled finger in the almost congealed pool of blood that had collected on the deck of the turntable smeared the finger across the bottom of a sheet of thick yellowing paper and then disappeared off into a dark and hidden other world whistling a strange and vicious tune and returning only briefly to collect its scythe
